### Instructions for Fulfilling Pull Requests Based on `.pr.md`

1. **Read the `.pr.md` File:**

   - Open `.pr.md` and carefully read the entire document.
   - Understand the **Description** section to grasp the purpose of the pull request (PR).
   - Pay attention to the goals, background, and design decisions outlined in the description.

2. **Modify Files as Needed:**

   - Based on the tasks listed in the **Tasks** section, locate and modify the relevant files in the current directory to meet the PR requirements.
   - Ensure all requested changes, updates, or additions are applied according to the tasks outlined in the PR.

3. **Track Progress Using the Task List:**

   - As you work through each task listed under the **Tasks** section, update `.pr.md` to reflect your progress:
     - Add checkboxes to the list for each completed task, using `- [x]` for completed tasks and `- [ ]` for tasks yet to be done.
     - Modify the task list as needed if new tasks arise during implementation.

4. **Testing and Validation:**

   - Ensure all necessary tests are updated or created as specified in the **Tasks** section.
   - Run tests to verify that the changes are functioning correctly.
   - If no tests are listed in the tasks but you believe they are necessary, consider adding an entry for updating tests.

5. **Visual Confirmation (If Applicable):**

   - If the **Screenshots** section is present, add visual confirmation (screenshots, GIFs, etc.) of any UI changes.
   - If there are no visual changes, leave this section as is or remove it if irrelevant.

6. **Handling Related Issues:**
   - If the PR references specific issues (under **Related Issues**), make sure the changes properly address the issue(s) mentioned.
   - Use the `Fixes #` or `Closes #` notation to reference the appropriate issue(s) that will be resolved by the PR.
7. **Notes for Reviewers:**

   - Review the **Notes for Reviewers** section for any specific instructions or concerns the PR author has raised.
   - If you encounter any additional details or areas of concern while working on the PR, document them in this section.

8. **Final Update to `.pr.md`:**
   - Once all tasks are completed and changes have been made, review `.pr.md` one last time.
   - Make sure all tasks are properly checked off, any relevant notes have been added, and that the PR is ready for review.

By following these instructions, you'll be able to process and fulfill pull requests efficiently while ensuring clear communication and accurate tracking of progress through the `.pr.md` file.
