# Declarative AI Application Template

This repository is a template for creating Declarative AI Applications.
It consists of a template (`.pr.md`) file and associated instructions (`.instruct.md`) that instructs an LLM how to use the template.

## How to use this templated.

1. Remove this readme

(Not really necessary, but good practice)

```shell
rm -rf readme.md
```

1. Clone this template repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:johnhenry/declarative-ai-application-template.git
```

3. Fill out the `.pr.md` file describing the application that you would like to build

4. Instruct your AI to follow instructions in `.instruct.md`

   (I like to open up Claud AI and type "do .insturct.md")
