## Description

This PR initializes an npm library that transforms GraphQL queries into mock data.
It uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tag and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snaplet/copycat as a basis for the library.
The library utilizes the latest ES features including but not limited to top-level await, arrow functions, and destructuring.
It targets node.js environments.

## Tasks

- [x] Come up with a unique and creative name for the project: "mock-ql-sculptor"
- [x] Create all the standard bells and whistles for an npm library (package.json, .gitignore, etc., MIT license)
- [x] Create library that parses GraphQL and returns mock data in that shape
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for the library using 'node:test'/'node:assert'
- [x] Create a CLI that allows you to pass in a GraphQL file and get back mock data
- [x] Add tests for CLI
- [x] Create a comprehensive readme.md file
- [x] Add an MIT license
- [x] Initialize a git repository using `gh` and push the code to the repository

## Summary of Work Completed

1. Created a new npm library called "mock-ql-sculptor"
2. Implemented the core functionality to parse GraphQL queries and generate mock data
3. Developed a CLI tool for easy use of the library from the command line
4. Created comprehensive tests for both the library and CLI using node:test and node:assert
5. Added all necessary npm package files (package.json, .gitignore, etc.)
6. Included an MIT license for the project
7. Created a detailed README.md with installation instructions, usage examples, and API documentation
8. Initialized a git repository and pushed the code to GitHub

## Notes for Reviewers

- The library uses the latest ES features and targets Node.js environments
- The mock data generation is currently based on field names and could be extended for more sophisticated mocking in the future
- The CLI tool accepts a GraphQL file as input and outputs the mock data as JSON
- All code is thoroughly tested, but additional edge cases could be considered for even more robust testing
- The project structure follows npm best practices and is ready for publication

Please review the implementation and provide any feedback on code structure, error handling, or potential improvements to the mock data generation logic.
