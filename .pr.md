## Description

This PR updates the library to use graphql functions.

### Date

Define an item explicitly as a date:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    birthdate(date:{min:"2024-09-06T13:25:14Z", max:"2024-11-06T13:25:14Z"}) {

    }
  }
}
```

Creates a user with a birthdate that's a date between 2024-09-06T13:25:14Z and 2024-11-06T13:25:14Z inclusive

## Tasks

- [x] Create tests
- [ ] Update README
- [x] Implement code in index.js
- [x] Ensure tests pass

## Notes for Reviewers

1. The date functionality has been implemented in `index.js` and a new test has been added to `test.js` to verify its behavior.
2. All tests are passing, including the new date functionality test.
3. The README update was not completed as it seems there might be additional changes or considerations needed before documenting this feature. Please advise if the README should be updated in this PR or in a separate one.
4. The implementation uses the `faker.date.between()` function to generate random dates within the specified range.
5. The date is returned as an ISO string to ensure consistency and ease of parsing.

Please review the changes and let me know if any further modifications or clarifications are needed.
