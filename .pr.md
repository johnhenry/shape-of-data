## Description

This PR updates the library to use graphql functions.

### Count

Control numerosity:

```graphql
query {
  user {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

returns a single user

```graphql
query {
  users(count: 10) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

returns 10 users

### Number

Define an item explicity as a number:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id(number:{min:1, max:10, float:false}) {

    }
  }
}
```

Creates a user with an id that's an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive

## Tasks

- [x] Create tests
- [x] Update README
- [x] Implement code in index.js

## Notes for Reviewers

1. New tests have been added to 'test.js' to cover the new GraphQL functionality:

   - Test for the 'count' parameter to generate multiple users
   - Test for the 'number' type with min and max constraints

2. The README has been updated with:

   - New features description in the Features section
   - Examples of using the new functionality in the Usage section
   - Detailed explanation of the new features in the API Documentation section

3. The code has been implemented in index.js:

   - Added support for the 'count' parameter to generate multiple items
   - Implemented the 'number' type with min, max, and float constraints
   - Modified the existing functions to accommodate these new features

4. All tests are now passing successfully, including the test for handling the number type with min and max constraints.

Please review the changes and ensure that the new functionality is correctly implemented and documented. If you have any suggestions for improvement or spot any issues, please let me know.
